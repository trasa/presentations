* Divided into Projects

* No VS Tooling support for any of this (yet)
	(Really Important: Requires Hand-hacking of the sln at this point)	

* Two Types of Areas: Main (Parent) and Child
* Account and Store are slimmed down MVC Projects (they'll inherit some settings from the Main Area)
* Account.Routes.cs & Store.Routes.cs
* Main/Views/Shared/LogOnUserControl.ascx -- Cross-Area Linking Example

* You may be disappointed by this implementation of Areas.
