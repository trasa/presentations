Test Driven Development Overview
Tony Rasa - Boise Code Camp 2008

Thanks to everybody who attended.  If you have more questions (and I know
that you do!) *PLEASE* email me at trasa@meancat.com, also I will be 
adding new testing content to the blog at http://blog.meancat.com/trasa
filling in the gaps on some topics I mentioned but didn't have the time to
explore in as much depth as I wanted.

the tags/before-tests directory contains the same project before we added
in Mocks and Dependency Injection, and the trunk contains the "after" code
once we refactored a few things around.

thanks
